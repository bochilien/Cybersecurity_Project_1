## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

**Note**: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace `diagram_filename.png` with the name of your diagram image file.

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.
Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network
- Load Balancers protect against distributed denial of service attacks, and ensure availabilty. The advantage of a jump box is a provide restricted access to your network enviroment_.

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the operating system and system services.
- Filebeat monitors file logs, collects log events and forwards them for indexing.
- Metricbeat records metrics and statistics from an operating system and services running on a server_.

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function          | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|-------------------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway           | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | DVWA Container    | 10.0.1.4   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | DVWA Container    | 10.0.1.5   | Linux            |
| Web-3    | DVWA Container    | 10.0.1.6   | Linux            |
| ELKvm    | ELK/Kibana Server | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- 204.145.147.105_

Machines within the network can only be accessed by SSH.
- The Jump Box was allowed access the ELK VM? It's IP Address was 10.0.0.4_.

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | YES                 | 204.145.147.105      |
| Web-1    | NO                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-2    | NO                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-3    | NO                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| ELKvm    | YES                 | 204.145.147.105      |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- The main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible, is that it allows IT administrators to automate away the drudgery from their daily tasks. That frees them to focus on efforts that help deliver more value to the business by spending time on more important tasks_.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install Docker.
- Create & Attach a container.
- Create Filebeat on Web Vm's.
- Create Filebeat configuration file.
- Create Filebeat installation play.
- Verify the installation & playbook.

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

**Note**: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace `docker_ps_output.png` with the name of your screenshot image file.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- 10.0.1.4
- 10.0.1.5
- 10.0.1.6

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeats
- Metricbeats

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Filebeat monitors file logs, collects log events and forwards them for indexing. E.g auditd module collects and parses logs from the audit daemon.
- Metricbeat records metrics and statistics from an operating system and services running on a server. E.g MongoDB module perodically fetches metries from MongoDB servers.

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the Ansible playbook file to /etc/ansible/files.
- Update the filebeat.yml file to include name, image, state and ports.
- Run the playbook, and navigate to the Filebeat installation page on the ELK server GUI to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? filebeat-playbook.yml Where do you copy it? /etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? The hosts file. How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on? By specifying the which host group that the various systems belong to_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running? http://20.75.51.63:5601/ ._

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
